# Flappy Bird
This is my first project using p5.js, and I decided to try and emulate the classic Flappy Bird game!
<br>
Core concepts of my code are drawn from The Coding Train's [github](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code/tree/master/CodingChallenges/CC_31_FlappyBird_p5.js).
<br>
Background music is from [www.bensound.com](http://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/corporate-pop), *Funky Element*.
<br>
## Basic Functions Implemented
* Bird jumping up and down
* Pipes moving right to left
* Stopping the game when bird crashes into pipe
* Restarting the game by clicking a button

## To Fix/Update
* Counting method (Streak)
* Increase difficulty as streak increases
* Improve the spacing of the pipes
